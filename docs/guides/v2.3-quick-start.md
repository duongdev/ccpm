## Typical Workflow

### Scenario: Add User Authentication

#### 1. Plan the task
```bash
/ccpm:plan "Add JWT-based user authentication" my-app

🔧 Subtasks created
⏰ Estimated time: 4-6 hours
```

#### 2. Create feature branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/PSN-30-jwt-auth
```

#### 3. Start work
```bash
/ccpm:work
# Auto-detects PSN-30 from branch name
```

Output:
```
🎯 PSN-30: Add JWT-based user authentication
✅ Status: In Progress

📋 Remaining subtasks:
  ├─ [ ] Implement token generation
  ├─ [ ] Add token validation
  ├─ [ ] Write tests
  └─ [ ] Update documentation

🚀 Suggested next step: Implement token generation
   Run: /ccpm:work
```

#### 4. Work and commit
```bash
# ... write code ...
git add src/auth/tokens.ts

/ccpm:commit "Add JWT token generation"
# Auto-formats: feat(PSN-30): Add JWT token generation
# Links to Linear automatically
```

#### 5. Save progress
```bash
/ccpm:sync "Implemented token generation, starting validation"
```

#### 6. Continue working
```bash
# ... write more code ...

/ccpm:commit "Add JWT token validation"
/ccpm:sync "Token validation complete, writing tests"
```

#### 7. Before PR, verify quality
```bash
/ccpm:verify
```

Output:
```
🔍 Running quality checks...

✅ Tests passing (24/24)
✅ Code style clean
✅ Performance acceptable
✅ Security scan passed

🎉 All checks passed!

Ready to merge? Run: /ccpm:done
```

#### 8. Complete the task
```bash
/ccpm:done
```

Output:
```
✅ Pre-flight checks: PASSED
📝 Creating pull request...
PR created: #1234

🔗 Linking to Linear...
Task moved to: Ready for Review

🎉 Task complete!
Teammates notified via Linear
```

## Auto-Detection Magic

All new commands auto-detect your issue ID from your git branch:

```bash
# Git branch: feature/PSN-30-jwt-auth
/ccpm:work    # ✓ Knows it's PSN-30
/ccpm:sync    # ✓ Knows it's PSN-30
/ccpm:commit  # ✓ Knows it's PSN-30
/ccpm:verify  # ✓ Knows it's PSN-30
/ccpm:done    # ✓ Knows it's PSN-30
```

**Standard format:** `feature/PROJ-123-description`

**No more copy-pasting issue IDs!**

---

## Backward Compatibility

**Don't worry about old commands!**

All old commands still work exactly as before:

```bash
# These still work fine
/ccpm:planning:create "title" project jira-id
/ccpm:planning:plan PSN-30
/ccpm:implementation:start PSN-30
/ccpm:verification:check PSN-30
/ccpm:complete:finalize PSN-30
```

When you use old commands, helpful hints appear:

```
✨ Pro Tip: The new /ccpm:work command is 55% faster!
  /ccpm:work  [auto-detects from branch]

```

## Feature Flags

New features are safely behind feature flags:

**View status:**
```bash
/ccpm:config feature-flags --show
```

**Disable new commands (revert to old):**
```bash
/ccpm:config feature-flags optimized_workflow_commands false
```

**Enable new commands:**
```bash
/ccpm:config feature-flags optimized_workflow_commands true
```

## Command Cheatsheet

| Task | Old Command | New Command | Faster |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Create + Plan | 2 commands | `/ccpm:plan` | 50% |
| Start work | `/ccpm:implementation:start PSN-30` | `/ccpm:work` (auto) | 55% |
| Save progress | `/ccpm:implementation:sync PSN-30 "msg"` | `/ccpm:sync "msg"` (auto) | 40% |
| Make commit | `git commit -m "..."` | `/ccpm:commit "msg"` | 60% |
| Check quality | 2 commands | `/ccpm:verify` | 45% |
| Complete task | `/ccpm:complete:finalize PSN-30` | `/ccpm:done` (auto) | 40% |

---

## Tips for Success

### 1. Use Standard Branch Names
```bash
# ✓ Good
feature/PSN-30-add-auth
fix/PSN-31-login-bug
docs/PSN-32-api-docs

# ✗ Avoid
my-new-feature
add-auth
bugfix
```

### 2. Use `/ccpm:plan` for Complex Features
```bash
# Good for complex features
/ccpm:plan "Add user authentication system"

# Works for simple tasks too
/ccpm:plan "Fix login button color"
```

### 3. Use `/ccpm:sync` Frequently
```bash
# After each completed subtask
/ccpm:sync "Completed JWT implementation"
# Keep teammates informed of progress
```

### 4. Use `/ccpm:commit` for Every Logical Change
```bash
/ccpm:commit "Implement token generation"
/ccpm:commit "Add token validation"
/ccpm:commit "Write authentication tests"
```

### 5. Always Verify Before PR
```bash
/ccpm:verify  # Check quality before PR
# Fix any issues if needed
/ccpm:done    # Then create PR
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't find your issue. Please provide issue ID manually."

**Problem:** Branch name doesn't match standard format

**Solution:** Provide issue ID explicitly:
```bash
/ccpm:work PSN-30
/ccpm:sync "message" PSN-30
/ccpm:commit "message" PSN-30
```

**Prevent:** Use standard branch names:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/PSN-30-description
```

### "No commits to verify"

**Problem:** No git commits yet, can't verify

**Solution:** Make some commits first:
```bash
git commit -m "..."  # Make a commit
/ccpm:verify         # Then verify
```

### "Command failed with error: XYZ"

**Solution:** Check error message and run help:
```bash
/ccpm:help COMMAND   # Show command help
/ccpm:work --help    # Show work command help
```
