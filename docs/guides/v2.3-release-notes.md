## What's New in CCPM v2.3

### 🚀 50% Faster Workflows with 6 New Optimized Commands

We've rebuilt the most-used CCPM commands from the ground up for speed and simplicity. The new commands use natural language and intelligent auto-detection to reduce tokens and execution time by up to 60%.

#### New Command: `/ccpm:plan`
**50% faster than `/ccpm:planning:create`**

```bash
# Old way (3 commands, ~8k tokens)
/ccpm:planning:create "Add user authentication" my-app JIRA-123
# ... waits for response ...
/ccpm:planning:plan WORK-123
# ... waits for response ...
/ccpm:planning:update WORK-123 "Add JWT endpoints"

# New way (1 command, ~4k tokens)
/ccpm:plan "Add user authentication with JWT" my-app
```

**Benefits:**
- Combined create + plan in one command
- Auto-detects project from git context
- 50% token reduction
- Interactive refinement mode
- Backward compatible with old command

#### New Command: `/ccpm:work`
**55% faster than `/ccpm:implementation:start`**

```bash
# Old way
/ccpm:implementation:start WORK-123
/ccpm:implementation:next WORK-123  # to get smart next action

# New way (1 command, auto-detected)
/ccpm:work
# Auto-detects issue from git branch (e.g., "WORK-123-add-auth")
# Shows smart next action automatically
```

**Benefits:**
- Auto-detects issue from branch name
- Smart routing (start vs resume)
- Shows next actions automatically
- 55% token reduction
- Works with or without issue ID

#### New Command: `/ccpm:sync`
**40% faster than `/ccpm:implementation:sync`**

```bash
# Old way
/ccpm:implementation:sync WORK-123 "Completed JWT endpoints"

# New way (auto-detected)
/ccpm:sync "Completed JWT endpoints"
# Auto-detects issue from branch
```

**Benefits:**
- Auto-detects issue from branch
- Git-aware change summary
- Shows progress automatically
- 40% token reduction

#### New Command: `/ccpm:commit` (Entirely New!)
**60% faster than manual git commits + Linear comment**

```bash
# Old way (manual)
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT endpoints"
# then manually add Linear comment about commit

# New way (automatic)
/ccpm:commit "Add JWT endpoints"
# Auto-formats conventional commit
# Links to Linear automatically
# Updates Linear ticket
```

**Benefits:**
- Conventional commit format automatic
- Auto-links to Linear issue
- Updates Linear automatically
- Follows your project's conventions
- 60% token reduction

#### New Command: `/ccpm:verify`
**45% faster than verification workflow**

```bash
# Old way (2 commands)
/ccpm:verification:check WORK-123
/ccpm:verification:verify WORK-123

# New way (1 command, auto-detected)
/ccpm:verify
# Auto-detects issue and runs all checks
```

**Benefits:**
- Combined check + verify in one command
- Auto-detects issue from branch
- Shows all checks in one view
- 45% token reduction

#### New Command: `/ccpm:done`
**40% faster than completion workflow**

```bash
# Old way (3+ steps)
/ccpm:complete:finalize WORK-123
# Manual PR review
# Manual Jira sync

# New way (1 command, auto-detected)
/ccpm:done
# Pre-flight checks
# Creates PR
# Syncs Linear
# Cleans up
```

**Benefits:**
- All-in-one completion
- Pre-flight safety checks
- Auto-creates PR
- Syncs Linear automatically
- 40% token reduction

### 🎯 Smart Auto-Detection

All new commands auto-detect issue IDs from your git branch name:

```bash
# Git branch: feature/WORK-123-add-auth
/ccpm:work        # ✓ Knows it's WORK-123
/ccpm:sync "Done" # ✓ Knows it's WORK-123
/ccpm:commit      # ✓ Knows it's WORK-123
/ccpm:verify      # ✓ Knows it's WORK-123
/ccpm:done        # ✓ Knows it's WORK-123
```

No more copy-pasting issue IDs! The commands work with:
- Standard format: `PROJ-123`
- Long format: `feature/PROJ-123-description`
- Branch aliases: Maps branch name to issue automatically

### 🚁 Linear Subagent for 50-60% Better Performance

Behind the scenes, we've optimized how we interact with Linear by introducing a dedicated subagent that handles all Linear operations. This provides:

- **Session-level caching**: 85-95% cache hit rate
- **Batch operations**: Groups multiple requests
- **Error handling**: Intelligent retries and fallbacks
- **Token reduction**: 50-60% fewer tokens for Linear operations

You don't need to do anything—it works automatically!

### 📊 Feature Flags for Safety

All new features are behind feature flags, which means:

- **Zero Risk**: Can disable any feature instantly if issues arise
- **Gradual Rollout**: Features roll out in stages:
  - Beta (Dec 9): 10% of users
  - Early Access (Dec 21): 30% of users
  - GA (Jan 6): 100% of users
- **User Control**: You can disable features if you prefer old commands
- **A/B Testing**: Some features use A/B variants for testing

To view or change feature flags:

```bash
/ccpm:config feature-flags --show
/ccpm:config feature-flags optimized_workflow_commands false  # Disable new commands
/ccpm:config feature-flags optimized_workflow_commands true   # Enable new commands
```

### 🔄 100% Backward Compatible

**All old commands still work!**

```bash
# These still work exactly as before
/ccpm:planning:create "title" project jira-id
/ccpm:planning:plan ISSUE-123
/ccpm:implementation:start ISSUE-123
/ccpm:implementation:sync ISSUE-123 "message"
/ccpm:verification:check ISSUE-123
/ccpm:verification:verify ISSUE-123
/ccpm:complete:finalize ISSUE-123
```

When you use old commands, you'll see helpful migration hints:

```
✨ Pro Tip: You just used /ccpm:planning:create

The new /ccpm:plan command does this faster (50% fewer tokens):
  /ccpm:plan "title" my-app
