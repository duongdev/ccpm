**What happens:**
- Old commands work as before
- New commands available alongside
- Feature flags default to safe values
- No breaking changes

**Optional:** Initialize new config:
```bash
/ccpm:config init
# Creates ~/.claude/ccpm-config.json
```

---

### Q: Do I Need to Configure Feature Flags?

A: No, they work automatically!

**Optional:** View or change settings:
```bash
/ccpm:config feature-flags --show
/ccpm:config feature-flags optimized_workflow_commands false  # Disable if needed
```

---

## Command Questions

### Q: What's the Difference Between `/ccpm:plan` and `/ccpm:planning:create`?

A: **Functionality:** Both create and plan tasks, but...

| Aspect | Old `/ccpm:planning:create` | New `/ccpm:plan` |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Commands needed | 2 (create + plan) | 1 |
| Tokens | ~8,000 | ~4,000 |
| Speed | ~30 sec | ~15 sec |
| Parameters | 3 (title, project, jira-id) | 2 (title, project) |
| Better | No | Yes ✓ |

**Migration:** Use `/ccpm:plan` for all new tasks.

---

### Q: How Do the Auto-Detect Commands Work?

A: New commands read your git branch name to find the issue ID automatically.

**Example:**
```bash
# Git branch: feature/PSN-30-add-auth
/ccpm:work    # ✓ Auto-detects PSN-30
/ccpm:sync    # ✓ Auto-detects PSN-30
/ccpm:commit  # ✓ Auto-detects PSN-30
/ccpm:verify  # ✓ Auto-detects PSN-30
/ccpm:done    # ✓ Auto-detects PSN-30
```

**How it works:**
1. Reads current git branch name
2. Extracts issue ID (e.g., PSN-30)
3. Uses it automatically
4. No need to provide it!

**Supported formats:**
- `feature/PSN-30-description`
- `fix/PSN-30-description`
- `docs/PSN-30-description`
- Any branch with `PSN-30` in it

---

### Q: What If My Branch Name Doesn't Have the Issue ID?

A: Provide it manually:

```bash
# Branch: feature/my-auth-feature (no issue ID)
/ccpm:work PSN-30              # Provide ID explicitly
/ccpm:sync "Done" PSN-30       # Provide ID explicitly
/ccpm:commit "message" PSN-30  # Provide ID explicitly
```

**Better:** Use standard branch names:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/PSN-30-add-auth  # Includes issue ID
/ccpm:work  # Now auto-detects!
```

---

### Q: Do I Have to Use the New Commands?

A: No! Old commands still work perfectly.

**You can:**
- Use only new commands
- Use only old commands
- Mix old and new commands
- Switch between them anytime

**No risk.** Both work simultaneously.

---

### Q: How Does `/ccpm:commit` Work?

A: It automates git commits with Linear linking.

```bash
/ccpm:commit "Add JWT token validation"
```

**What it does:**
1. Creates a git commit
2. Auto-formats as conventional commit: `feat(PSN-30): Add JWT token validation`
3. Links to Linear automatically
4. Updates the task

**Benefits:**
- Consistent commit format
- Automatic Linear linking
- Follows project conventions
- 60% token reduction

**Works with:**
- Any branch with issue ID in name
- Manual issue ID if needed
- All project configurations

---

### Q: What's `/ccpm:verify` vs `/ccpm:verification:check` and `/ccpm:verification:verify`?

A: `/ccpm:verify` combines both in one command.

**Old workflow:**
```bash
/ccpm:verification:check PSN-30   # Run checks
# Review checks...
/ccpm:verification:verify PSN-30  # Confirm ready
```

**New workflow:**
```bash
/ccpm:verify  # Auto-detects PSN-30
# Shows all checks + asks for confirmation
```

**Same result, simpler process.**

---

### Q: What's `/ccpm:done` vs `/ccpm:complete:finalize`?

A: `/ccpm:done` is the next generation.

**Old way:**
```bash
/ccpm:complete:finalize PSN-30
# Manual PR creation
# Manual Linear updates
```

**New way:**
```bash
/ccpm:done  # Auto-detects PSN-30
# Pre-flight checks
# Creates PR automatically
# Updates Linear automatically
# Cleans up
```

**More automated, fewer manual steps.**

---

## Feature Flags Questions

### Q: What Are Feature Flags?

A: Controls that let you enable/disable new features safely.

**Purpose:**
- Gradual rollout (not everyone at once)
- Safe testing (can disable instantly)
- User choice (you control which features you use)
- A/B testing (compare old vs new)

**Example:**
```bash
# Disable new commands, use old ones
/ccpm:config feature-flags optimized_workflow_commands false

# Enable new commands
/ccpm:config feature-flags optimized_workflow_commands true
```

---

### Q: Should I Enable Feature Flags?

A: Try them! They're what make v2.3 better.

**During beta (Dec 9-20):**
- Feature flags enabled by default for beta testers
- Safe to use and test
- Report any issues

**During early access (Dec 21 - Jan 3):**
- Available to broader audience
- Safe to use
- Feedback welcomed

**During GA (Jan 6+):**
- Enabled by default for all users
- Can disable if preferred

---

### Q: How Do I Check Feature Flag Status?

A: Use the config command:

```bash
/ccpm:config feature-flags --show
```

Output:
```
Feature Flags Status:
├─ optimized_workflow_commands: enabled (🟢)
├─ linear_subagent_enabled: enabled (🟢)
├─ auto_detect_from_branch: enabled (🟢)
├─ shared_linear_helpers: enabled (🟢)
├─ legacy_command_support: enabled (🟢)
└─ monitoring_collection: enabled (🟢)
```

---

### Q: Can I Disable Specific Features?

A: Yes! Control each feature individually.

```bash
# Disable new commands but keep old ones
/ccpm:config feature-flags optimized_workflow_commands false

# Keep new commands but disable auto-detection
/ccpm:config feature-flags auto_detect_from_branch false

# Re-enable a feature
/ccpm:config feature-flags optimized_workflow_commands true
```

**Use cases:**
- Prefer old commands? Disable new ones
- Auto-detection causing issues? Disable it
- Want to test? Enable specific features

---

## Backward Compatibility Questions

### Q: Do Old Commands Still Work?

A: Yes, 100%! All old commands work exactly as before.

**Supported old commands:**
- `/ccpm:planning:create` ✓
- `/ccpm:planning:plan` ✓
- `/ccpm:planning:update` ✓
- `/ccpm:implementation:start` ✓
- `/ccpm:implementation:next` ✓
- `/ccpm:implementation:sync` ✓
- `/ccpm:verification:check` ✓

- **Aug 2026 onwards**: 6-month deprecation window begins
- **Later in 2026**: Considered for removal

**You have plenty of time** to migrate at your pace.

---

### Q: Can I Mix Old and New Commands?

A: Absolutely! Both work together seamlessly.

**Example workflow:**
```bash
/ccpm:plan "New feature" my-app     # New command
/ccpm:implementation:start PSN-30   # Old command (still works)
/ccpm:work                          # New command (auto-detects)
/ccpm:implementation:sync PSN-30 "msg"  # Old command (still works)
/ccpm:done                          # New command (auto-detects)
```

**No conflicts.** Use whatever you prefer.
