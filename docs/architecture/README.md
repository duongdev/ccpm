# Architecture Documentation

System architecture and design decisions for CCPM.

## System Architecture

- **[Skills System Architecture](skills-system.md)** - Complete architecture of the CCPM skills integration system
- **[Documentation Structure](documentation-structure.md)** - Design proposal for documentation organization

## Architecture Decision Records

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) will be added here as the project evolves.

## Design Principles

CCPM follows these core architectural principles:

1. **Hook-Based Automation** - Automate agent invocation and quality enforcement through Claude Code's hook system
2. **Context-Aware Intelligence** - Smart agent selection based on scoring algorithms
3. **Safety-First** - Require explicit confirmation for external system writes
4. **Spec-First Development** - Promote comprehensive specification before implementation
5. **Progressive Refinement** - Support iterative planning and implementation
