## Recommendation

The core research and planning is complete. The two most critical skills (sequential-thinking for problem-solving and ccpm-code-review for quality gates) are fully implemented.

The remaining 4 skills can be implemented quickly:
- docs-seeker: 30 minutes (copy ClaudeKit version with minor CCPM notes)
- ccpm-debugging: 1-2 hours (adapt debugging frameworks for Linear)
- ccpm-mcp-management: 1-2 hours (focus on CCPM servers)
- ccpm-skill-creator: 1-2 hours (CCPM templates)

**Total remaining**: ~5 hours to complete all 8 skills

**Status**: Ready for final implementation push
